# Synthedic_Healthcare_data
This folder has three python files that can create the example outputs that also exist in this folder.  These python files create complex and highly realistic healthcare claims that are used for demos and product development to find and remove fraud, waste, and abuse.  There are a variety of different columns to match true healthcare claims.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
